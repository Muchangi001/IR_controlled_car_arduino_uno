A robotic car that is controlled using IR signals from a tv remote.<br>
**Components used:**<br>
     * Arduino uno board. 
     * Motor driver(L298N)->for controlling the speed and direction of the gear (DC) motors.  
     * Two gear motors attached to the chassis.  
     * 4.Two wheels for each gear motor and 1 extra for maneuvering.  
     * 12V battery->to power the arduino uno.  
     * 6V battery ->to power the motor driver.  
     * An infra red receiver->for capturing IR signals.  
     * A TV remote ->for sending IR signals to control the car.
